Implemented User Stories:

However can be improved with additional time.
Utilised MERN stack but also included redux for attempted easier state management and tailwind css, given various pages required for scalability and multi-user access.
However this was tricky to clean/implement.


Required User Stories
You are required to features to fulfil the following user stories:

1. [Completed] As a customer, I want to see a list of fruits that are available to buy (complete with stock and pricing information), so that I can decide which fruits I want to buy.

2. [Completed] As a customer, I want to keep track of the fruits and quantity that I have shortlisted (including the total amount I need to pay), so that I can adjust my purchasing decisions as I shop.

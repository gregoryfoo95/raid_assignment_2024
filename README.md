## Description

This project is a functional e-commerce application built using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to browse and purchase fruits online. Redux was implemented for state management and Tailwind CSS for attempted responsive design, ensuring a scalable experience for multiple users. While the core functionalities are complete, there are definitely opportunities for further improvements and enhancements.

## Features

1. <ins>[Completed]</ins> As a customer, I want to see a list of fruits that are available to buy (complete with stock and pricing information), so that I can decide which fruits I want to buy.
2. <ins>[Completed]</ins> As a customer, I want to keep track of the fruits and quantity that I have shortlisted (including the total amount I need to pay), so that I can adjust my purchasing decisions as I shop.
3. <ins>[Completed]</ins> As a customer, I want to submit my order of the fruits I selected, so that I can complete my purchase when I am done shopping. Assume that payment is done separate from this POS application.
4. <ins>[Attempted. Pending Cleaning of data]</ins> As an owner, I want to see the orders that my customers have submitted, so that I can fulfill their orders.
6. <ins>[Completed]</ins> As an owner, I want to be able to add new fruits and amend my stock levels, so that I can keep my online store up to date.
11. <ins>[Attempted responsive design]</ins> As a customer, I want to be able to use the app on my phone so I can shop on the go.
14. <ins>[Attempted]</ins> As an owner, I want to be able to serve millions of customers at the same time, so that I can scale my business.
15. <ins>[Completed]</ins> As an owner, I do not want my customers to be able to see the whole store's order history, or amend my stocks, or perform any actions that should only be available for me.
17. <ins>[Attempted]</ins> As a customer, I want the fruit store pages to load quickly at all times, so that I can browse and shop without delays.

## Pending Implementation:

5. As an owner, I want to see the total sales for each day and for each fruit, so that I can track the performance of my store.
7. As a customer, I want to be able to log in and see my order history, so that I can track my previous purchases.
8. As a customer, I want to be able to re-order a previous order, so that I can quickly purchase the same items again.
9. As a customer, I want to know how many people are currently considering buying a fruit, so that I can make a quick decision before the stock runs out.
10. As a customer, I want to be able to ask the store owner common questions about a fruit, so that I can make an informed decision about my purchase.
12. As a customer, I want my order shortlist to be saved so that I can continue shopping on my device layer, even if I have not logged in.
13. As a customer, after logging in, I want my order shortlist to be saved so that I can log in and continue shopping on another device later.
16. As an owner, I want my customers' order submissions to be encrypted, so they cannot be intercepted by my competitors.
